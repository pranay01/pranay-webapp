Most people don't allow themselves time to figure out what they really like doing. Either they don't have enough support to give themselves this time, or they don't trust themselves enough. They know they don't like what they are doing, but they don't really see what else they could do.

Trusting yourself enough to give yourself this chance is **hard**. And the world doesn't fail to tell you what could go wrong if you deviate from the known path.

I don't have much too say, but to ask you to see this video ðŸ‘‡. He has said it far more succinctly than I ever could. 

To quote just one line - "Like in all matters of heart, you will know when you find it".

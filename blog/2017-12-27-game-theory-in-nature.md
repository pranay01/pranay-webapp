I recently came across Robert Sapolsky's lecture on Human Behavioral Biology. Here is the complete series available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL150326949691B199).

One of things which struck me was how results derived from Game Theory have been observed in nature among living organisms. One of the famous results in game theory is about [Evolution of Cooperation](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~axe/research/Axelrod%20and%20Hamilton%20EC%201981.pdf) by Axelrod. The same effects were observed in populations of organisms in natural settings.

The lecture series is filled with many gems like these. If you have interest in understanding origins of human behavior, do check out this lecture series.

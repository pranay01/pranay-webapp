"Why is number of people paying down today? What is the install to paid conversion for Facebook ads today? How is the new app release performing?"

In my last role as a product lead at a series A funded startup, these were the questions I would start my days with. Of course we had all sorts of dashboards reflecting how are different metrics performing - but it didn't answer the most crucial questions - WHY?

Why are conversion numbers down? Why are install lowers with same budget? Is it because of new app releases? Is it because there are some issues in the payment gateways - leading to more failure rate?

I had to come up with different angles to question the data - and come up with an explaination of the metric change. I was a human anomaly detector.

Now given that the metrics can could explode very quickly - esp. if you consider yourself as a "data savvy" org - this would take a lot of time to explore? Also, there may be hidden factors which I may not be looking at which was causing the change

What are the real cause of an issue? And what are just correlations or observed effects. The causation vs correlation question is really a pin, I must tell you

The silver lining is that since we have more and more data being logged about our business, why can't we apply the same techniques which we apply in monitoring of dev infra - to business metric monitoring? 

How do business metrics differ from dev metrics?

1. The business topology is not very well defined 
Getting the correlations pinned down is non-trivial. 
2. Many times business data is not clea
What if you use modern data lake softwares like Snowflakes and your data pipelines are in order

If we have this level of visibility about the business, businesses can be made more efficient & faster to react. You don't need to waste your PM/Biz bandwidth on trying to answer questions (which could get very biased if humans are tasked with the task of analysing the data) - and do more second order thinking and trying to come up with new ideas to try.

To pin down in an example,

I used to lead product for a telemedicine consultation startup

(Or take a more easily understood startup - like say Uber)

-> Number of people who opened app to order

**Target for a PM persona**

Imagine you are product manager at Uber

Why lower? Why Higher? Is it temporary - can it be built into a feature?

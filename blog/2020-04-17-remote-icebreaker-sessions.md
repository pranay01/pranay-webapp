Today I attended a SaaS Virtual Happy Hour meetup organized by Nathan Latka of [GetLatka](https://getlatka.com). It was a really fun event. The attendees were SaaS founders and investors. Every few minutes you would be paired with a random person in the group and you will chit-chat for 3-4 minutes. 

There were ~70-80 people who were live for ~1 hr event. I met 5 people from different corners of the world. Poland, London, New York City & Germany. Two of them had recently been to India. One even has a dev team in India.

It was curious meeting people from different parts of the world whom I would not normally meet. You could say that 3-4 minutes was a very small time to chat on any thing in detail - but it was good to get to know about the other person.

The session was powered by this SaaS product - [https://icebreaker.video](https://icebreaker.video) . Do check it out.

For someone who is building a global SaaS product, this is really a blessing ðŸ˜€

[Walden](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16902.Walden) is a book by noted American essayist & philosopher Henry David Thoreau.  Originally published in 1854, this book is a vivid account of the time that Henry D. Thoreau lived alone in a secluded cabin at Walden Pond.

I picked up this book a few days back. I am still in the first few pages, but already have some notes which I thought to share.

**On Choice**

Most men (and women) deliberately chose a common mode of living as they really think that they don't have any choice left.  In this passage, Thoreau reminds us of testing our assumptions and prejudices. We need to re-test the standard way of doing things - and check if it is still the best suited one.

**On comforts of life**

In this passage, Thoreau points that the modern comforts of life are in fact hindrances in mankind reaching a higher state. The wisest men in almost all religions have spent a simple life - something he called as "*voluntary poverty*"

If the wisest men of their time have lived a simple life, does running after material gains really matter?

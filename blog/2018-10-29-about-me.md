I have been an engineer, product manager, marketeer and entrepreneur.  Currently exploring the crazy world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

I started [TapDiscover](http://www.tapdiscover.com/) in 2015. The broad ideas was to make long tail products in local markets easily discoverable. 

Currently based out of Bangalore, India.

Dev communities thrive on meetups. These are places where you come to know about interesting things other people are working on, people working on them and build a professional and social network.

Before COVID hit the world, all my Saturday mornings were infallibly reserved for meetups. And Bangalore, being the tech hub it is, gives you a good buffet of meetups to choose from.

With coming of COVID though, things are a lot different. We are confined to our houses and dev communities are trying to figure out new, interesting ways to interact online. In this context, I was pleasantly, surprised when I came across a DevOps meetup which is organized on Animal Crossing.

If you are not aware, [Animal Crossing](https://animal-crossing.com)is a popular social simulation video game. Here is what wikipedia has to say about it:

> ***Animal Crossing*** is a [social simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_simulation_game)[video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game) series developed and published by [Nintendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo) and created by [Katsuya Eguchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsuya_Eguchi). In *Animal Crossing*, the [player character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_character) is a human who lives in a village inhabited by various [anthropomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism) animals, carrying out various activities such as fishing, bug catching, and fossil hunting.

I am pretty excited to see how this meetup will turnout. If you want to attend, just for the heck of it, here's the [link](https://desertedisland.club)

I recently stumbled upon this [interview](https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/andrew-ng_n_7267682?ri18n=true) from Andrew Ng, arguably one of the guys single handedly responsible for making Machine Learning popular and accessible. 

In his interview, there is a beautiful excerpt which I want to highlight. When asked: 

***Do you have any helpful habits or routines?***

He answers:

Reading 6 research papers a week seems like a lot, but I think if one can read even one research paper per week, that will germinate lots of new ideas.

Especially for folks who operate in technical domains like I am (my startup is in a domain called [observability](https://signoz.io), this practice would give them new ideas to think about, and possibly innovate on. 

While entrepreneurs don't have the luxury to engage in deep research and compare results, they could learn a lot just by grokking through the research papers and at least understand what the basic concepts are. And then let the human mind do its magic ðŸ¦„. May be on some opportune day, when you are talking to a customer, hearing his issues and wondering how to solve it, one of these ideas will present itself before you. Boom! ðŸ’¥

Adrian Colyer, who has been CTO at VMWare and currently is venture partner at Accel, has actually brought this idea to practice. He runs a blog - [The Morning Paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/) where he discusses interesting computer science research paper every week. 

There's also a [meetup group](https://paperswelove.org/) which discusses research papers periodically and has chapters in many cities of the world. Fortunately they also have a [chapter](https://paperswelove.org/chapter/bangalore/) in Bangalore. I will try to attend one their meetups, once in-person meetups are back again, hopefully ðŸ¤ž

So, which research paper are you picking today?

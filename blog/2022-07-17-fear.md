Fear is a strange thing. It undermines our belief in ourselves. But it also protects us from doing things which can hurt us. 

That is the reason, why evolution has selected this trait across generations.

If it has been preserved across generations of evolutions, it must be good - right? Well the answer may not be so simple.

More often than not, fear is a mental construct. It originates from our thoughts and torments us there.

Authors of famous books and series have also opined on it.

> “Fear is the path to the dark side … fear leads to anger … anger leads to hate … hate leads to suffering.” 

— "The Phantom Menace," 1999


> “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”

― Frank Herbert, Dune

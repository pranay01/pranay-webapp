# Observability: An Origin Myth

Imagine, for a moment, a world of pure signal.  
Packets glide like fireflies through fiber canyons; traces unfurl in perfect chronological lacework.  
In this early eon no gatekeepers stand between engineer and insight.  
Everything is **open**—code, protocol, wonder.  
They call this era **Telemetry Genesis**.

### The Pact of the Tinkerers
Across IRC nebulae and GitHub hamlets, the Tinkerers share recipes:

* A dash of Prometheus scrape.  
* A sprinkle of Grafana dreams.  
* A cauldron named *Jaeger* chasing traces through the dark.

Outages become camp-fire stories; pull-requests, passports to new realms.  
The stack is messy, sure, but it is _ours_.  
And for a while, that is enough.

## The Rise of the Paywall Kingdoms

Then the marketers arrive, riding glittering dashboards that load in nine milliseconds and invoice in milliseconds, too.  
They whisper promises:

* **“No servers to run.”**  
* **“One button to correlate it all.”**  
* **“Free trial (card on file).”**

Teams, exhausted from pager-fatigue, step willingly behind the velvet rope.  
They trade YAML for swipe-cards, root for role-based access, and in doing so create the **Observability Kingdoms**—walled gardens ruled by latency SLOs and monthly active budgets.

Soon the Kingdoms learn a powerful spell:

> **Host Based Pricing**

Logs blossom; invoices metastasize.  
Finance teams hold post-mortems that contain no incidents—just line items.  
Engineers begin to ask a heretical question:

> *“Are we observing our systems, or are they observing our spend?”*

### The Forgotten Git Rebellion
In a quiet corner of the internet, a rebel message appears:

> **“Standards over silos.”**

The signature reads **`opentelemetry`**—lowercase, like a secret handshake.  
Old-school maintainers and day-zero cloud natives gather under its banner.  
They do not promise silver bullets, only **interoperability**—and the right to choose one’s own destiny.

## The Return of the Sigils

Legend tells of a forge in the clouds where old runes are recast.  
The forge’s name is **SigNoz**.

* It speaks fluent OTLP, PromQL, and plain old JSON.  
* It wears the MIT license like mithril.  
* It invites everyone—not just the credit-card holder—to the party.

And so begins the **Re-Opening**:

1. **Forks multiply.** Star-counts climb like vines up stone walls.  
2. **Adapters appear.** Even closed-source agents learn to speak OpenTelemetry lest they be left behind.  
3. **Cost becomes a variable again—one you can grep for in a Makefile.**

Product managers notice something unsettling: churn curves bending toward “open”.  
They schedule off-sites to discuss “community strategy.”  
Meanwhile, in Slack channels with names like `#observability-freedom`, architects drop a single link:

> `git clone https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git`

The spell is simple, the exodus quiet—but unstoppable.

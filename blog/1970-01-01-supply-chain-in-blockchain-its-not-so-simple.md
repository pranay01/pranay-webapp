Application supply chain is considered as one of the use cases which is very intuitive. Obviously there are problems of trust in supply chain and people think that blockchain can be used to bring more trust to this system.

Reliance on sensors/ IoT

Ambrosus - data binding token with items tracked in supply chain

Inherent digital fingerprint - Diamond

Everledger

Humans have a fingerprint/iris pattern which is inherent to them. Not all objects have such unique fingerprints.

There have been efforts to uniquely map timbers for tracking( but non of the projects have achieved mainstream adoption)

2. 
Slock.it - Locking

General consensus that Blockchain will be adopted by  industry first and will start from evenagelisation by CTO

Many problems are those of digitisation and not of decentralisation

If you are starting now, do you do digitisation or decentralization

Claim - Blockchain provides Traceability

Reality - You should be careful here  - even blockchain doesn't provide traceability. Its the IoT sensors which provide traceability - its just that the database to which you write is a censorship resistant db ( " The blockchain") In case of supply chain, blockchain only helps because there are multiple parties involved - and if the supply chain data is stored in the db of a single party - than they can arbitrarily edit it. So, blockchain is helpful, because each party in the supply chain can run a node - and see all the transactions happening in the network.

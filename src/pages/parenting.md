A large part of what we are today is because I had lovely parents who gave us (me and my brother) a lot of attention. How would we be as a parent is still TBD. But I want to give it my best shot regardless. 


This page is just a log of my notes on parenting and collection of articles I resonated with. More of a reminder to myself than anything else

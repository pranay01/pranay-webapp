# Me in 10 seconds

I have been an engineer, product manager, marketeer and entrepreneur. Currently, building [SigNoz](https://signoz.io), an open source observability platform.

I started TapDiscover in 2015. The idea was to make long tail products in local markets easily discoverable.

Currently based out of Bangalore, India.
